Studying the temperature variation in solidification is the first step towards determining the material properties.
Generally, solidification leads to two types of grain morphologies : columnar and equiaxed. Temperature gradient affects the type of morphology developed, which in turn affects the mechanical properties of the solid.
We can estimate the temperature variation with the help of analytical Rosenthal solution.
